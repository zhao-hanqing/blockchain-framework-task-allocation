What is ARGoS-Epuck?
--------------------

ARGoS-Epuck is a plugin that enables the use of the E-puck robot in ARGoS. ARGoS-Epuck contains
the software modules for both the physical robot and its simulated version. Therefore, the
user can develop a control software for the E-puck and test it in a virtual environment and then port
the same control software, without modifications, on the real E-puck. In order to be used on the
real E-puck, the plugin requires the robots to be equipped with a Linux extension board (Gumstix Overo computer-on-module (COM)).
Depending on the needs of   the user, the capabilities of the basic model of the E-puck
can be enhanced with the following extensions: a ground sensor, a range-and-bearing board, and
an Omnivision module.

ARGoS-Epuck is released under the terms of the MIT license.

Downloading ARGoS-Epuck
-----------------------

You can download the development sources through git:

 $ git clone https://github.com/demiurge-project/argos3-epuck argos3-epuck

Compiling ARGoS-Epuck
---------------------

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before executing the following commands, you need to download, compile, and install argos3: https://github.com/ilpincy/argos3

Compiling the code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The compilation of ARGoS is configured through CMake.

Compiling for the simulator
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 $ cd argos3-epuck
 $ mkdir build
 $ cd build
 $ cmake ../src
 $ make
 $ sudo make install

If you wish to load the library without installing:
$ export ARGOS_PLUGIN_PATH=build_simepuck/plugins/robots/e-puck

Compiling for the E-puck
++++++++++++++++++++++++

For the real robot, after installing the cross compilation tool and cross-compiling and installing argos3 (detailed instructions in doc/installation.pdf):

 $ cd argos3-epuck
 $ mkdir build_realepuck
 $ cd build_realepuck
 $ cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../src/cmake/TargetEPuck.cmake ../src
 $ make
 $ sudo make install
